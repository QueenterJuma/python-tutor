#Python Variables
    """
Variables are containers for storing data values
They must be created before they can be used in
an expression or statement. Variable names cannot start with
a number and can contain letters (A-Z
and a-z), digits (0-9
and underscore _). There are several types of
variables available in Python like local variables, global variables
and built-in variable.

In python, variables are created when you first assign a value to it:

y = "Hello, there!"

Multiple lines can be commented using triple quotes '   """
"""
This is a multiple lines comments which spans across
multiple lines and uses three double quotes on each side

#Python Data Types
#Built-in DAta Types
"""
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType
"""
#Getting the Data Type  
"""
You  can use the type() function to get the data type of any variable like this:
print(type("Hello"))    #Return
<class 'str'>
print(type(10))         #Return
<class 'int'>

x = True
print(type(x))          #Return
<class 'bool'>        #Notice that
#Python treats capitalized words as
#True when used in Boolean context. 
"""
#Setting the Data Type
"""
In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

Example	         Data Type
x = "Hello World"	str	
x = 20	int	
x = 20.5	float	
x = 1j	complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	tuple	
x = range(6)	range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset	
x = True	bool	
x = b"Hello"	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview	
x = None	NoneType
"""
#Python Numbers
"""
There are three numeric types in Python:
int
float
complex
The int() function converts a number or string  
to an integer. If no argument is given,
it returns zero. 
The float() function converts a number or 
string to a floating point number.
argument is supplied it returns zero.
The complex() function creates a complex number.
It takes two arguments: the real part and the
imaginary part. A complex number can be
written with j instead of i. For example,
4 + 3j represents the same number as
4 + 3*j.

"""
#Random Number
"""Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to
make random numbers:

Example
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))"""

#Python Casting
"""You can use the int(), float(),
and complex() functions to cast values from one type
to another. The str() function can also be
used to convert a value to a string."""

#ExampleGet your own Python Server

#Integers:
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

#Floats:
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

#Strings:
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'

#Python Strings
"""
A string is a sequence of characters. You can
create strings by enclosing characters in quotes.
There are two types of quotes you can use:
single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").
If you need to include a quote within a string
you can use either single or double quotes around it
or escape the quote with a backslash (\).
"""
#Multiline Strings
"""Strings can span multiple lines if they are en
closed in triple quotes ( """ """) or (''' '''). Newlines
are included in the string as \n."""
#Raw Strings
"""Raw strings donâ€™t have any special meaning for
backslashes, so you can include literal back
slashes in them without having to worry about
escaping them. Raw strings are created using
the prefix r instead of the regular prefix. For
example:
r"\n\tHello World!" becomes "\
"""

#Strings are Arrays
"""In Python, strings are arrays of bytes
that encode Unicode characters. If you want
to access individual characters in a string,
you can do so like this:
print(s[0]) # prints first character
print(s[-1]) # prints last character
"""
#Looping Through a String
"""
Since strings are arrays, we can loop 
through the characters in a string, 
with a for loop.
Example
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
  Output: 
  b
  a
  n
  a
  n
  a
  """
#String Length
'''
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
The len() function returns the length of a string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
Output: 13
'''
#Check String
'''
To check if a certain phrase or character is 
present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
Check if "free" is present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
Output: True

**Use it in an if statement:

Example
Print only if "free" is present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.") #Output: Yes , 'free' is present.
'''
#Check if NOT
'''
To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, 
we can use the keyword not in.

Example
Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt) 
Output: True

***Use it in an if statement:

Example
print only if "expensive" is NOT present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
  Output: No, 'expensive' is NOT
'''
#PYTHON STRINGS
#Strings
'''A sequence of characters enclosed by double or single quotes (
'' or ") is called a string in Python.
String literal are displayed by print() fuunction

Example:
print("Hello World")
Output: Hello World

print('Hello World')
Output: Hello World
'''
#Assign String to a Variable
'''
Assigning a string to a variable is done with the
 variable name followed by an equal sign 
 and the string

 Example:
 my_string = "This is a string."
 print(my_string)
 Output: This is a string.
'''
#Multiline Strings
'''
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

Example
You can use three double/single quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
Output: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, conse
ctetur adipiscing elit,sed do eiusmod 
tempor incididuntut labore et dolore 
magna aliququa.
'''
#Strings are Arrays
'''
Strings in Python are arrays of bytes 
representingunicode characters

However, Python does not have a character data type, 
a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

**Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
Example
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])  # Output: e
'''
